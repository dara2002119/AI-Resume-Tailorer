## How It Works  

1. **Input**:  
   - A Markdown resume (`resume.md`)  
   - A job description (plain text)  

2. **Processing**:  
   - Cleans up Markdown (spacing, bullets, headings)  
   - Passes resume + JD into GPT with a tailored prompt (limits word count, bullets, and roles)  
   - Ensures all sections (Education, Skills, Experience, Projects) are preserved  

3. **Export**:  
   - Uses `pypandoc` + `python-docx` to apply a custom Word template  
   - Formats name and contact info centered at the top  
   - Outputs a **one-page `.docx` file** ready to submit
